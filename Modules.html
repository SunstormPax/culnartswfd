      <h3>Modules</h3>
      <p>With the exception of third year which is spent on Industrial Work Placement or International Studies, each semester of the Culinary Arts Course contains between 4 and 5 different modules, at least 1 of which is always elective.

		<p>Semester 3 continues culinary skills, this time in much more advanced detail, as well as focusing on both food analysis and financial accounting and how it relates to business.
