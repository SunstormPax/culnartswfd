      <h3>IT facilities</h3>
      <p>The Walton building, more commonly known as the IT building, is a building in SETU that provides access to state-of-the-art computers with extremely efficient broadband and wifi access. These computers include practically every type of industry standard software required for any course in the college. While lectures often take place in this building, there are approximately 30 buildings meaning there is always a selection of free rooms should students ever require access to software outside of class-time.</p>
      <p>While Culinary Arts are generally a more physically oriented subject, there are modules that do require the use of technology. These include Information and Communication Technology, Financial Accounting, and Research Methodology. Since some students may not posess their own laptops or the software reuired for these modules, this building will allow them to work on any assignments they may need to without having to leave the campus.</p>
