      <h3>Waterford Transport&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>Waterford is generally considered to be an easy city to move around. A part of this is due to the city's relatively small size, but can also be attributed to its efficient transport links.</p>
      <p>The most common method of travelling around Waterford is by bus. Bus Eireann provides five different bus routes that cover the entire layout of the city, with buses for each route departing every half hour. Bus trips will generally cost around €2.20 per ride, but using a TFI Leap card (which can be purchased online for €5 and is reusable) will reduce this to as little as €0.65 per trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		 <p>In terms of travelling into and out of Waterford, the best methods are by bus and train. Bus Eireann provides hourly buses that will travel from Waterford city centre to areas such as Dublin, Cork, Clonmel, Wexford and Tramore. All of these can be paid for using a leap card, with the longest journeys costing a maximum of €13.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Waterford also has its own railway station, run by Iarnrod Eireann. This line only travels to Dublin, but will be able to transport you there in under two hours. Around seven trains run each day with tickets for students costing around €10.54 each.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
