      <h3>Accommodation</h3>
      <p>Waterford is generally much easier and cheaper to find accommodation in than other Irish cities, particularly Dublin and Cork</p>
      <p>SETU provides accommodation services to students studying there. It features a college campus (located within the college itself) and the larger town campus (located 15 minutes away).</p>
		<p>The college campus is the smaller of the two, only including 66 rooms, however, these rooms wi-fi, parking and laundry services. The town campus is located further into Waterford, being made up of two 4-story apartment blocks, with a total of 96 apartments and 360 bedrooms. You will most likely have to share if you get one, but they do feature wifi, kitchens, parking and recreational areas. Adding yourself to the waiting list does require a €300 deposit, but this will be returned if you do not get a place. If you do, an SETU room will usually cost a total of around €5000 over the course of an academic year.</p>
		<p>If you are unable to secure a room within the college, it is usually possible to find accommodation in other areas of Waterford. Places such as Railway Square, Aylesbury Manor, Riverwalk and Templars Hall have achieved good reputations for being extremely friendly to students, providing them with good service for reasonable pricing.</p>
