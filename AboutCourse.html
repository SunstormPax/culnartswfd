      <h3>Culinary Arts&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>The Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Culinary Arts is a 4-year course run by the South East Technological University. The course covers every area relevant to the food industry, including cooking, journalism, food safety, microbiology and budgeting.</p>
      <p>While the course takes place over 4 years, it is split into 8 different semesters, each lasting for 12 weeks with a week-long midterm as well as a revision week towards the end. Semester 1 generally starts in September and ends in early December while semester 2 begins in January and carries through until April, with May to August being treated as Summer break.</p>
	<p>Each of the course's 8 semesters will focus on different modules, none of which are repeated, meaning that, should a student not enjoy a particular subject, they will only have to put up with it for a single semester. Each semester includes either 4 or 5 modules, at least 1 of which is always elective, allowing the student to choose which area they would prefer to study. The only exception to these rules is the third year, where instead of studying modules, the student will spend both semesters either on Industrial Work Placment or studying abroad on SETU's Erasmus program.</p>
